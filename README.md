# Restic Agent
This is a collection of BASH scripts to run and manage linux backups with restic to backblaze.

The scripts are designed to be added to multiple hosts backing up to the same bucket. The restic repos are also added with an optional 'master' key in mind, the master key should be applied to all repos allowing restoration if you lose the local key for them. This master key is also used allow checks from a single host against all its clients.
